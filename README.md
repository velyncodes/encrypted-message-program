# Encrypted Message Program

An encrypted messaging application that enables users to send secret messages by disguising the content within.

It employs the one-time pad (OTP) encryption technique, which uses a key or pad that is as long as the message itself and is used only once.

## What I learned

- The use of random numbers in message encryption
- Employing iteration to encrypt individual characters
- The insecurity of techniques like the Caesar cipher
- The importance of keeping encryption keys confidential
